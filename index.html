        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jeremiah Jamero. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside, aiming to earn my Bachelors degree in Biochemistry. I graduated from Marshall Fundamental in Pasadena, California in June 2016. I plan on applying to pharmacy school after I graduate from UCR. My goal is to work either in a community pharmacy or in the emergency room of a hospital. <br><br>

        After graduating high school, I went to Pasadena City College. I was there for three years, taking classes to fulfill my majorâ€™s prerequisites in order to transfer to a four-year institution. These classes consisted of primarily calculus, biology, chemistry, and physics, with a few other electives. While I was in community college, I was a part of several clubs, such as Caduceus and Alpha Gamma Sigma. Caduceus was a club that focused on providing resources, information, and opportunities to students pursuing the medical field. In this club, I had the chance to manage a few blood drives on campus and also visit several local medical schools. Alpha Gamma Sigma was an honors club that focused on building leadership and study skills. I participated in tutoring opportunities such as in one of the local middle schools. I also held a position in the treasury committee where I assisted in managing the clubâ€™s funds. At UC Riverside, I am currently in Future PILLS â€“ pharmacists interested in learning leadership skills. This club is focused in preparing undergraduate students for pharmacy school. In addition to pharmacist and admission faculty speakers, we also have community service work around the Riverside area.<br><br>

        During the summers in between each school session, I worked several jobs. For two summers, I worked as an intern for a middle school summer program that I was once a part of when I was younger; it was called Partnership For Success!. I assisted teachers with their daily routine, while also teaching a few students. One summer, I also worked as a studio manager assistant at the Armory, a local art gallery that offered various classes to all ages. I helped manage the logistics of the studio by organizing schedules and filling out paperwork, while also watching over the children who took the art classes. I also worked at FedEx Corporation as a package handler. I loaded and unloaded packages in delivery trucks, assuring they are en route to the correct destination.
